  <img src="docs/assets/architecture.svg" alt="Generic reference Linux edge hardware feeds Zyvor Device Agent, which discovers identity, health, GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART, CAN, read-only CAN capture, USB and watchdog state, then hands that off to Nodra for protocol and data-plane work and to Fleet for control-plane/lifecycle. Nodra in turn owns Modbus, J1939, OPC-UA, BLE, serial and LoRaWAN protocol decoding." width="720">
</p>

## Why this exists

Zyvor already has higher layers for workload/runtime control and fleet/data-plane responsibilities. What was missing was a small Linux-native hardware foundation that can run directly on an ARM64 gateway without Kubernetes. Device Agent provides that boundary.

It intentionally does **not** interpret Modbus registers, CAN/J1939 PGNs or OPC-UA nodes. It reports physical capabilities and gives sensor drivers a stable local contract. Nodra owns industrial protocol semantics, routing and offline store-and-forward. Fleet owns remote lifecycle and desired state. Axiom can later consume the node capability model but is not required on the device.

## Is this for you?

Device Agent is a small, single-purpose, open-source (Apache-2.0) hardware
layer for a Linux edge gateway — not a home-automation hub, not a
container fleet/OTA platform, and not tied to any one cloud vendor. If you
need one of those instead, one of the alternatives below is probably a
better fit; if you need a lightweight, protocol-agnostic hardware/health
layer that hands industrial protocol semantics and fleet lifecycle to
purpose-built systems instead of doing everything itself, that's exactly
this project's scope.

| | **Device Agent** | Home Assistant | balena | AWS IoT Greengrass | Azure IoT Edge |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Primary scope | Hardware inventory, health, bounded sensor/bus access | Home automation hub, integrations, local rules | Fleet OS + container deployment/OTA | Cloud-connected edge runtime | Cloud-connected edge runtime |
| Cloud dependency | None required — Nodra/Fleet integration is optional | None required | balenaCloud (proprietary) for fleet management | AWS IoT Core | Azure IoT Hub |
| License | Apache-2.0 | Apache-2.0 (core) | Open-source agent + proprietary cloud | Proprietary (free tier) | Proprietary (free tier) |
| Industrial protocol decoding (Modbus/CAN-J1939/OPC-UA) | Deliberately out of scope — handed to Nodra | Via community integrations, not built for industrial fieldbus | Not built-in | Via custom components | Via custom modules |
| Fleet/OTA orchestration | Out of scope — handed to Zyvor Fleet | Not built-in | Core feature | Via AWS services | Via Azure services |

*(General characterizations as of writing, not exhaustive — verify current
details against each project's own docs before deciding.)*

**Supported hardware**: `docs/REFERENCE_HARDWARE.md` defines a capability
profile, not a certified SKU list — arm64 is first-class, amd64 works for
development/CI, and any board meeting the minimum bus requirements (1×
ethernet/I²C/UART/CAN; GPIO/SPI/USB/watchdog recommended) is supported.
There is no fixed hardware compatibility list to check against; if your
board exposes standard Linux `/dev`/`/sys` interfaces for these buses, it
works.

New to Device Agent? [`docs/FAQ.md`](docs/FAQ.md) covers licensing,
support, production-readiness and data-residency questions, and
[`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) covers the issues
people actually hit.

## Industrial bus layer (v0.1.2)

Device Agent now enriches SocketCAN from Linux sysfs and optional read-only `ip -j -details -statistics` output. It surfaces `BUS-OFF`, nominal bitrate, CAN-FD data bitrate, controller error counters, netdevice counters, driver and physical/virtual classification. It never opens or decodes CAN frames.

RS485 discovery is deliberately passive. Declare the board port explicitly, or let Linux device-tree properties identify it:

```toml
[industrial]
can_ip_command = "ip"
rs485_ports = ["ttyS1"]
publish_to_nodra = true
```

Protocol meaning still belongs to Nodra. The proposed Modbus RTU adapter seam is documented in `docs/NODRA_MODBUS_RTU_CONTRACT.md`.

## Read-only CAN capture (v0.1.3)

Disabled by default. When enabled, Device Agent binds only the explicitly allowlisted SocketCAN interfaces on a receive-only raw socket — there is no transmit endpoint and capture never changes bitrate, CAN-FD mode, restart policy or controller state. Accepted frames are rate-limited per interface and kept in a bounded in-memory history.

```toml
[industrial.can_capture]
enabled = true
interfaces = ["can0"]
history_limit = 512
max_frames_per_second = 200
include_error_frames = false
publish_to_nodra = true
```

Raw frames (classic, extended, and CAN-FD with BRS/ESI flags) are available over REST/SSE and, when enabled, published to per-interface Nodra topics. Device Agent does not decode J1939 PGNs — see `docs/CAN_CAPTURE.md` and `docs/NODRA_J1939_HANDOFF.md` for the hand-off to Nodra's `j1939-device-agent` connector.

## API auth and Unix socket (v0.1.4)

The API is unauthenticated by default (`auth.mode = "none"`), matching v0.1.0–v0.1.3. Set
`auth.mode = "bearer"` to require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every `/api/*` route
and on `/metrics`, except `auth.exempt_paths` (`/api/v1/health` and `/api/v1/ready` by
default, so probes never need a token — note
`/metrics` is **not** exempt). The bundled dashboard's static shell (everything outside
`/api/*`/`/metrics`) is always unauthenticated, regardless of `auth.mode` — it carries no
device data, and needs to load before it can show its own token prompt. The daemon never
stores the raw token, only its SHA-256 hash:

```toml
[auth]
mode = "bearer"
exempt_paths = ["/api/v1/health", "/api/v1/ready"]

[auth.bearer]
token_hash_file = "/etc/zyvor/device-agent/auth/bearer.sha256"
```

`./scripts/deploy-remote.sh HOST --auth-mode bearer` generates the token and installs the
hash automatically (same pattern as `../fabric`'s admin-password bootstrap), and prints a
ready-to-paste Prometheus scrape-config snippet for `/metrics` (which requires the same
bearer token — Prometheus supports this natively via the `authorization:` scrape-config
block, no code-side change needed):

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: zyvor-device-agent
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['HOST:9188']
    authorization:
      type: Bearer
      credentials: <token>
```

The bundled dashboard (`web/dashboard`) also understands bearer auth: it prompts for a token
on first load against a bearer-protected agent (stored in that browser's `localStorage`
only), and re-sends it on every request. SSE uses authenticated `fetch()` with the
`Authorization` header. Camera `<img>` routes use short-lived stream tickets from
`POST /api/v1/stream-tickets` (`?ticket=`), never the long-lived bearer on a query string.

A second, additive API listener over a Unix domain socket is available for same-host callers
(Fleet, Nodra) that would rather use kernel peer-credential checks than carry a token:

```toml
[server.unix_socket]
enabled = true
path = "/run/zyvor-device-agent/api.sock"
allow_uids = [1000]
allow_gids = []
```

Empty `allow_uids`/`allow_gids` deny everyone — both must be explicitly populated.

## mTLS enrollment (v0.1.4)

`auth.mode = "mtls"` moves auth to the TLS layer: the daemon terminates TLS with its own
issued certificate and, with `require_client_cert = true`, rejects any connection whose
client certificate isn't signed by `auth.mtls.client_ca_file` — at the handshake, before
the request reaches application code. `zyvor-device-agent enroll` generates a keypair and
CSR and submits them to `enrollment.server_url`; Device Agent implements only this client
side of the handshake and never signs certificates itself — see
`docs/MTLS_ENROLLMENT.md` for the protocol and why. `serve` refuses to start in `mtls` mode
until `enroll` has run; `zyvor-device-agent identity` prints the current certificate's
subject, issuer and validity, plus which key backend produced it.

`identity.backend = "tpm"` (optional, `--features tpm2`) generates and signs that private
key inside a TPM2 instead of a PKCS#8 file, falling back to software at runtime if the TPM
can't be opened — see `docs/TPM2_IDENTITY.md`.

## CORS and rate limiting (v0.1.4)

Both apply only to the TCP listener (not the Unix socket, where neither concept applies):

```toml
[server.cors]
enabled = false          # off by default — the bundled dashboard is same-origin
allowed_origins = []

[server.rate_limit]
enabled = true           # on by default — pure DoS protection, no behavior change
requests_per_second = 20 # per peer IP
burst = 40
```

CORS is opt-in: only needed for a dashboard/integration served from a different origin
than the agent itself. Rate limiting defaults on with generous limits since it only ever
affects abusive traffic, not normal usage.

## TLS (v0.1.5, optional)

Off by default. `server.tls.enabled` serves plain HTTPS on the same TCP listener — unlike
`auth.mode = "mtls"`, no client certificate is ever required, so an ordinary browser can
reach `https://<host>:9188/` directly with no extra setup:

```toml
[server.tls]
enabled = true
cert_path = "/etc/zyvor/device-agent/tls/server.crt"
key_path = "/etc/zyvor/device-agent/tls/server.key"
```

If no cert exists at those paths, one is generated automatically on first start (a
self-signed cert covering `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`::1`/hostname/detected local IP) — a
browser will show a trust warning until you accept it or replace the cert with a real one
by mounting it at the same paths, which is never overwritten if already present.
Independent of `auth.mode`: enabling TLS doesn't change who can call the API, only
whether the connection is encrypted, so pair `server.tls.enabled = true` with
`auth.mode = "bearer"` for anything beyond a loopback bind. `auth.mode = "mtls"` still
takes its own separate TLS path (see the mTLS section above) rather than this one, since
that mode ties TLS to client-certificate verification.

`scripts/deploy-remote.sh`'s and `scripts/verify-deployment.sh`'s built-in health checks
only speak plain `http://` — with `server.tls.enabled = true` they report `HEALTH_FAIL`/
`FAIL` even on a perfectly healthy daemon, because the daemon is now correctly TLS-only.
That's expected, not a broken deployment; verify by hand instead:

```bash
curl -sSk https://127.0.0.1:9188/api/v1/health
```

(`-k` accepts the self-signed cert unless you've mounted a real one).

## Configurable health thresholds (v0.1.4)

Off by default. When enabled, thermal zones and SocketCAN controller error counters are
checked against configured levels once per inventory-refresh tick, emitting
`threshold.breached`/`threshold.recovered` on the SSE event stream (and the Nodra
agent-event topic, if `nodra.enabled`) only on the edge transition — not every tick a
value stays over/under a level:

```toml
[thresholds]
enabled = true
thermal_warn_celsius = 75.0
thermal_critical_celsius = 90.0
can_error_counter_warn = 96      # CAN error-warning, per the CAN spec
can_error_counter_critical = 128 # CAN error-passive, per the CAN spec
```

## Config hot-reload (v0.1.4)

`SIGHUP` re-reads the config file and applies `auth.*`, `thresholds.*`,
`plugins.*`, `fleet.*`, and the parts of `industrial.*`/`nodra.*` that are
read fresh on each request/tick — without a restart:

```bash
sudo systemctl kill -s HUP zyvor-device-agent
```

`server.listen`, `server.unix_socket.*`, and `server.dashboard_dir` are bound
once at startup and can't be rebound live; changing one of those and sending
`SIGHUP` applies everything else but logs a warning that a full restart is
still needed for those specific fields. Likewise, `nodra.*` (the MQTT
connection itself) and `industrial.can_capture.*` (which interfaces the
capture threads have open) are only read once at their own startup — a
reload updates `state.config` for everything else, but reconnecting Nodra or
re-opening CAN capture sockets still needs a restart. A malformed config file
is logged and ignored on `SIGHUP`, keeping the daemon on its last-known-good
config rather than crashing or half-applying a broken reload.

## Packaging (v0.1.4+)

Signed `.deb` and `.rpm` packages (**amd64 and arm64**) are attached to each
GitHub Release, alongside multi-arch tarballs. Both install the same layout as
`scripts/install.sh` (`/usr/bin/zyvor-device-agent`,
`/usr/lib/systemd/system/zyvor-device-agent.service`,
`/etc/zyvor/device-agent.toml`, profiles, and the disabled-by-default I2C
reference plugin) but deliberately **do not** enable or start the service —
that stays an explicit `systemctl enable --now zyvor-device-agent` after
reviewing the config, matching `install.sh`'s own philosophy.
`/etc/zyvor/device-agent.toml` is a conffile (dpkg)/`%config(noreplace)`
(rpm): a locally-modified config survives a package upgrade or reinstall, and
`dpkg -r`/`rpm -e` leave it and the profiles/plugin manifests in place rather
than deleting them. Arm64 packages are built natively on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`
(see `scripts/package-deb-rpm.sh` and CI `packages-arm64`).

```bash
sudo dpkg -i zyvor-device-agent_*.deb   # or: sudo rpm -i zyvor-device-agent-*.rpm
sudo systemctl enable --now zyvor-device-agent
```

Multi-arch (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) container images are published
to `ghcr.io/zyvorai/device-agent` on every tagged release — the fastest
path onto a small ARM64 device with no on-device Rust/Node build:

```bash
podman pull ghcr.io/zyvorai/device-agent:latest
```

See [7. Container deployment](docs/guides/07-container-deployment.md) for
device/bus flags, config/state volumes, and running it under systemd.

## Hotplug (v0.1.4, optional)

`--features hotplug` adds a raw `NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT` socket alongside the existing
polling inventory refresh (`device.inventory_refresh_seconds`, default 5s): a kernel uevent
for a bus the inventory tracks (`gpio`/`i2c`/`spidev`/`net`/`usb`/`tty`) triggers an
immediate re-scan instead of waiting for the next poll tick. Deliberately **not**
`udev`/`libudev.so` — this reads the same kernel-generated events udev does, without adding
a runtime library dependency the container image/`.deb`/`.rpm` don't otherwise need.
Off by default; opening the netlink socket is never fatal to the daemon — if it fails for
any reason, a warning is logged once and the daemon falls back to polling-only.

## Camera (v0.1.5, optional)

`--features camera` adds live snapshot + live MJPEG video streaming from an explicitly
allowlisted `/dev/video*` — the device-discovery and live-viewing half of the "Edge AI
bridge" line item in `docs/ROADMAP.md` (local inference/accelerator support is a separate,
still-unscoped future increment). Same posture as CAN capture: disabled by default, never
auto-opens an undeclared device, per-camera rate cap, bounded to the single newest frame:

```toml
[camera]
devices = []

[[camera.devices]]
id = "front-dock"
path = "/dev/video0"
enabled = true
max_frames_per_second = 10
```

```text
GET /api/v1/camera                    # status per configured camera
GET /api/v1/camera/{id}/snapshot      # latest frame, image/jpeg
GET /api/v1/camera/{id}/stream        # multipart/x-mixed-replace MJPEG, works in a plain <img>
```

Cameras offering native MJPG have those bytes passed straight through; others fall back to
a pure-Rust YUYV→RGB→JPEG software encode (`jpeg-encoder`, no `libjpeg`/`ffmpeg` dependency).
`publish_to_nodra` sends only health/presence to Nodra, never frame bytes. See
[8. Camera streaming](docs/guides/08-camera-streaming.md) and `docs/CAMERA.md`.

## Product boundary

```text
Device Agent: "There is a CAN interface named can0."
Nodra:        "0x18FF50E5 is engine temperature = 82°C."
Fleet:        "Apply config X to device ZY-REF-0001 and restart workload Y."
Axiom:        "This application requires CAN + 4 cores; this node is eligible."
```

This separation is a design rule, not just an implementation detail.

## UX principles

The dashboard is a **local hardware cockpit**. It opens on one screen showing device identity, health, CPU/RAM/temperature, detected physical interfaces, and Nodra/Fleet status. The visual language is intentionally minimal: system typography, white space, glass-like navigation, monochrome surfaces, dark diagnostics, and Zyvor orange used only for emphasis.

## First demo acceptance test

A clean ARM64 reference unit must be able to: install one Zyvor package → start the agent → auto-detect hardware → read one real sensor through a plugin → publish through Nodra → keep working during WAN loss → sync after reconnect through Nodra WAL → appear in Fleet through the existing fleet-agent → expose health for remote lifecycle operations.

See the [Documentation](#documentation) section below for the full walkthrough, from first boot to Fleet enrollment.
